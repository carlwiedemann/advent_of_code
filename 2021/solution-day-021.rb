# Part 2
# Each starting point will create several branching conditions.
#
# Every turn will generate 27 different universes, but several are duplicates, there are only 7 unique universes.
#
# Each of these 7 provides some score and potential way toward the score of 21.
#
# All score trees are identical and they create different mirrored position states as they descend. The position states
# then determine the score, and the score determines who wins or not.
#
# Both players will share a tree, since the universes are not exclusive to one player.
#
# This should be a dynamic programming problem. We should be able to populate unique node values that can later be
# summed up.
#
# Each node in the graph will have the following inputs:
#
# current_positions: [Integer p1, Integer p2]
# current_scores: [Integer s1, Integer s2]
# root_multiplier: Integer rm
#
# Using these values, we can calculate:
#
# winning_counts: [Integer wc1, Integer wc2]
#
# The node will either be a final winner for one of the players or not. If it is a final winner, then its winning_counts
# will be [rm * 1, 0] or [0, rm * 1], since the node itself has a multiplier value.
#
# If it is not a final winner, then its winning counts will be the array-sum of each child (there are 7) times the
# root multiplier, e.g.
#
# winning_counts = [0, 0]
# children.each do |child|
#   winning_counts[0] += child[0]
#   winning_counts[1] += child[1]
